# # For this example, the outer for loop uses an end of range index of 
# # 10. The value of index 10 will be 10-1, or 9.  
# for outer_loop in range(10):

#     # Using the "outer_loop" variable as the end of range for the  
#     # inner loop, means the end of range index will be 9. The value 
#     # of index 9 will be 9-1, or 8.
#     for inner_loop in range(outer_loop):

#         # The printed result is the value of "inner_loop". Since  
#         # there arenâ€™t any calculations in this loop, there is a 
#         # simple shortcut for solving what the final value printed 
#         # by the "inner_loop" will be. The solution is to simply use 
#         # the value of the "inner_loop" index, which is 8.
#         print(inner_loop)
